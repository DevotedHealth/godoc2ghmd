Thanks for taking the time to create a pull request.

Since this is a fork of a fork, it may make more sense to contribute to the upstream repository
in addition or instead of contributing here. The upstream forks are: 
<a href="https://github.com/GandalfUK/godoc2ghmd">https://github.com/GandalfUK/godoc2ghmd</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/davecheney/godoc2md">https://github.com/davecheney/godoc2md</a>, or
<a href="https://github.com/wdamron/godoc2gh">https://github.com/wdamron/godoc2gh</a>.

It may also be entirely possible that using one of those forks will solve your
immeadiate problem. That shouldn't stop you from creating the PR but might be faster.
